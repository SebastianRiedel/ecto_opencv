Asymmmetric Circles Grid
------------------------

To play with some of the samples you will want the
``ASYMMETRIC_CIRCLES_GRID`` fiducial, here are PDFs in :download:`US
Letter <Asymmetric_Circles_Grid_5x3_USLetter.pdf>`, and :download:`A4
<Asymmetric_Circles_Grid_5x3_A4.pdf>` formats. Print these out and
glue to a piece of cardboard.  In case you need it here is the
:download:`original InkScape SVG <Asymmetric_Circles_Grid_5x3.svg>`.
